**Abstract:**  
This paper examines Argentina's connection to international markets through exports, imports, and participation in global value chains (GVCs), assessing the implications for private sector–led economic growth. Using detailed firm-level trade data, we describe the evolution of Argentina’s trade dynamics over the past decade and benchmark its performance against 72 countries via the World Bank Exporter Dynamics Database. Our analysis reveals a progressive disengagement from international markets between 2006 and 2015, characterized by a 30% decline in the number of exporters, extreme export concentration (with the top 5% of firms accounting for 90% of export value), and limited firm turnover in export markets. These trends reflect high entry costs and policy environments that discouraged internationalization.
